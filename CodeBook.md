Study design and dataset

The features selected for this assignment come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ in Samsung mobile devices. More information about study design can be found in the README file in the „UCI HAR Dataset“ folder. In that folder complete study design as well as dataset is explained in details so there is no much point in describing it here again. The dataset with thorough explanation can be downloaded at: "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip".

Raw dataset details

Here only the list and short preview of the whole variable have been given

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern ('-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions):

tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag
The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are:

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
mad(): Median absolute deviation
max(): Largest value in array
min(): Smallest value in array
sma(): Signal magnitude area
energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values.
iqr(): Interquartile range
entropy(): Signal entropy
arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals
maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal
kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal
bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
angle(): Angle between to vectors.
Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

gravityMean
tBodyAccMean
tBodyAccJerkMean
tBodyGyroMean
tBodyGyroJerkMean
Variables name and type used in creating a final tidy dataset

Here are the list of variables extracted from the raw dataset used in a creation of tidy dataset. From 561 variables only 66 have been extracted. According to the requirements only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement have been extracted. Note: This doesn't include all the columns that have "mean" or "std" word in column name but mean and standard deviation only as a measurement. Example: fBodyGyro-mean()-Y is mean of the fBodyGyro variable and its column is extracted, but fBodyGyro-meanFreq()-Y is mean frequency of the fBodyGyro and thus not extracted.

For each record the following is provided:

Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope.
A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables.
Its activity label.
An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

Naming variables

Minimal adjustments of original dataset variables have been made as original ones are already very readble and concise enough. Thus only part of the variable names where measurement have been defined was separated from the rest of the name with underscore. The rest of the names stayed as cammel case. Two minor adjustments have been made: Replacing "t" and "f" with "Time" and "Freq" respectively and removing those strange parenthesis for every single variable.
